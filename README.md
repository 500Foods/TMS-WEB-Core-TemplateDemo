# TMS WEB Core Template: Demo
This repository contains an example of using [TMS WEB Core](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmswebcore.asp) with the [AdminLTE 4](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE/tree/v4-dev) (Bootstrap 5) template as a front-end to the [TMS XData Template: Demo Data REST API server](https://github.com/500Foods/TMS-XData-TemplateDemoData).

More details will be provded as this project unfolds.  Initially, only a few features have been implemented.  Starting with a Login page and a simple dashboard.  It is expected that this project will continue to advance in step with the XData project.
